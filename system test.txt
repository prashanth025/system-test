You discover a bug in the codebase. What steps do you take? 
1. first i will find which part of the code(it can be function, controller, component)
2. before debugging glancing through the code, to see if i can find out the bug in the code
3. if not debugging with suitable breakpoints
4. From debugging there could be issues like network, wrong api response, may be wrong api request
5. When identifying  the bug  after debugging the issue fixing it and ensuring that other functionality doesn't break with proper unit testing  


Describe the kinds of tests you would write at various points in the SDLC 

In SDLC functional testing, System integration testing, User integration testing and dry run testing
and last one is go live testing where testing is performed in production by the end users.


Given the below specification, please describe the test scenarios that you would write to test the function described. The scenarios may be simple scenario descriptions for your tests. Feature: ZIP (U. S. Postal) Code Formatter The system needs a method that correctly formats a string to match either standard US ZIP Code (e.g., 12345) or US ZIP Code +4 format (e.g., 12345-6789). The function accepts a string of digits of varying length as input and returns a formatted string. Standard US ZIP Code (e.g., 12345): If the input string is less than five digits, a zero-padded string of five digits is returned. An input string that is five digits long is returned unchanged. US Zip Code +4 format (e.g., 12345-6789): An input string between six and nine digits returns a string with the first five digits of the input string, a hyphen, and a zero-padded string of four digits in the input string using the remaining digits. An input string that is ten digits long is returned unchanged. 

Describe how DNS works as you would to a novice, from the browser (from page request to page load). 
	A domain name is human readable name – like amazon.com – that we type in a web browser URL field. 

Top Level Domain 
TLD refers to the last part of a domain name. For example, the .com in amazon.com is the Top level domain. The most common TLDs include .com, .net, org, and .info. Country code TLDs represent specific geographic locations. For example: .in represents India. Here are some more examples:

com – Commercial businesses.
gov – U.S. government agencies.
edu – Educational institutions such as universities.
org – Organizations (mostly non-profit).
mil – Military.
net – Network organisations.
eu – European Union.
Second level Domain
This is the part of a domain name which comes right before the TLD, “amazon.com”, for example.

Sub Domain
A sub domain can be created to identify unique content areas of a web site. For example, the aws of “aws.amazon.com”.
